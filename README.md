A very determined Junior Developer just graduated from Makers Academy who enjoys learning constantly, attending workshops, and improving her programming skills. 

I have always had a passion for Tech, but I never knew what path was right for me.
After travelling for over ten years around the world, I decided to settle down in London, start thinking about changing career, and work towards this new goal.

I started teaching myself how to code, following some free courses, completing katas, joining coding communities, and watching many tutorials on youtube.

In August 2021, I was offered the chance to volunteer for GenSpec for a side project. That was my first experience working in an agile dev team.

From November 2021 to February 2022, I attended Makers Academy, where I consolidated my knowledge of Ruby and JavaScript, learnt new frameworks, solidified best practices and processes used in Software Development, helped my teams succeed, and provided mentorship to some fellow students.

I would like to work for a company where I can continue to learn and contribute to its success.

## **Skills**
### **Fast learning**  
Since I was studying in Italy up to now, I have changed so many jobs.  
My first job in London was behind the bar, and I had to learn everything in two weeks. I had no prior experience preparing drinks, but I managed.  
During my ten years exploring the world, I worked an average of six months in between travels. When I was in Vancouver, I got promoted to a supervisory role after only two months. I quickly understand processes and procedures in a company and apply them.   
When I started volunteering at GenSpec, I barely knew what APIs meant. After the first meeting and researching all the techs we were about to use I was able to create my first Firebase function with TypeScript and test it successfully in few days (with Jest).  
I have attended many free online courses before joining Makers to learn the fundamentals of coding languages.
### **Problem solving/Critical thinking**  
Tech is second nature to me. Since I was a kid I have always loved building, destroying and re-building. My inquisitive mind on how things work makes finding solutions easier.
Family and friends often ask me for advices on how to fix or use their devices.  
When I was working for Getir (startup) as a Team Leader, problems would come up non-stop and I had to solve issues constantly. Our store was one with the best KPIs in the company.  
There were quite a few times during my time at Makers where I got a bit stuck (even during pairing), but I never gave up. The fact that something wasn't working as intended was a big challenge that I felt I had to solve. And I did 98% of the time only by researching.

### **Communication and Teaching**  
In the ten years travelling, I have greatly improved my communication skills personally and professionally. It is a neverending journey.  
I am a great listener and observer. Working in customer-focused jobs, I had to deal with so many people every day while staying calm.  
In Getir, I had to manage a team of over 20 colleagues. Employees would call every day with new issues and requests. With active listening, empathy, and organisational skills, I was able to maintain a happy team.  
I have trained many colleagues in previous roles or explained how things work to fellow students (even during the Makers pre-course). I often received positive feedback and helped many people get unstuck.
