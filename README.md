# **Riky Moroni**  
#### _Aspiring full stack developer_  

A very determined self-taught developer, embarking on a new journey with Makers Academy.  

After graduating from Italy, I left the country and spent the next ten years working and travelling around the world. While visiting New Zealand, I met a developer for the first time and was fascinated by his work. I always had a passion for tech, but travelling was a priority back then.  

After I settled down in London, I tried changing my career a few times with no success. I have to admit the pandemic pushed me in the right direction. I had to quit my comfortable job in catering and start thinking about the future. In February 2021, I got hired as a Store Assistant by a startup company and quickly got promoted to Store Supervisor with a salary never seen before in my career. But it was right then I realised that I didn't want just any job with a good salary.  

I's finally time to follow my passion for tech.

## **Skills**

_Tech skills: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Ruby, React, Flutter, TypeScript, Node.js, express._

**Fast learning**  
Since I was studying in Italy up to now, I have changed so many jobs.  
My first job in London was behind the bar, and I had to learn everything in two weeks. I had no prior experience preparing drinks, but I managed.  
During my ten years exploring the world, I worked an average of six months in between travels. When I was in Vancouver, I got promoted to a supervisory role after only two months. I quickly understand processes and procedures in a company and apply them.   
When I started volunteering at GenSpec, I barely knew what APIs meant. After the first meeting and researching all the techs we were about to use I was able to create my first Firebase Function and test it successfully in a few days.

**Problem solving/Critical thinking**
Tech is second nature to me. Since I was a kid I always loved building, destroying and re-building. My inquisitive mind on how things work makes finding solutions easier.
Family and friends often ask me for advices on how to fix or use their devices.  
When I was working in Getir (startup) as a Team Leader, problems would come up non-stop and I had to solve issues constantly. Our store was one with the best KPIs in the company.

**Communication and Teaching**
In the ten years travelling, I have greatly improved my communication skills personally and professionally. It is a neverending journey.  
I am a great listener and observer. Working in customer-focused jobs, I had to deal with so many people every day while staying calm.  
In Getir, I had to manage a team of over 20 colleagues. Employees would call every day with new issues and requests. With active listening, empathy, and organisational skills, I was able to maintain a happy team.
I have trained many colleagues in previous roles or explained how things work to fellow students (even during the Makers pre-course). I often received positive feedback and helped many people get unstuck.

**Leadership**  
Always starting as a Team Member, I have often got promoted to Team Leader or Supervisor in a short time. Managers easily trust me and recognise I take responsibilities seriously.  
In 5 months with Getir I got promoted from Store Assistant to Team Leader to Supervisor.
