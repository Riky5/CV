### _Junior full stack developer_  

A very determined self-taught web developer just graduated from Makers Academy.  

After graduating from Italy, I left the country and spent the next ten years working and travelling around the world. While visiting New Zealand, I met a developer for the first time and was fascinated by his work. I always had a passion for tech, but travelling was a priority back then.  

After settling down in London, I tried changing my career a few times with no success. I have to admit the pandemic pushed me in the right direction. I had to quit my comfortable job in catering and start thinking about the future. In February 2021, I was hired as a Store Assistant by a startup company, quickly promoted to Store Supervisor, and on the path to becoming Store Manager. At that moment, I realised I didn't want just any job.   
It was finally time to follow my passion for tech.

## **Skills**

_Tech skills: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Bulma, JavaScript, Ruby, Rails, React, Flutter, TypeScript, Node.js, express, postgreSQL_

### **Fast learning**  
Since I was studying in Italy up to now, I have changed so many jobs.  
My first job in London was behind the bar, and I had to learn everything in two weeks. I had no prior experience preparing drinks, but I managed.  
During my ten years exploring the world, I worked an average of six months in between travels. When I was in Vancouver, I got promoted to a supervisory role after only two months. I quickly understand processes and procedures in a company and apply them.   
When I started volunteering at GenSpec, I barely knew what APIs meant. After the first meeting and researching all the techs we were about to use I was able to create my first Firebase function with TypeScript and test it successfully in few days (with Jest).

### **Problem solving/Critical thinking**  
Tech is second nature to me. Since I was a kid I have always loved building, destroying and re-building. My inquisitive mind on how things work makes finding solutions easier.
Family and friends often ask me for advices on how to fix or use their devices.  
When I was working for Getir (startup) as a Team Leader, problems would come up non-stop and I had to solve issues constantly. Our store was one with the best KPIs in the company.  
There were quite a few times during my time at Makers where I got a bit stuck (even during pairing), but I never gave up. The fact that something wasn't working as intended was a big challenge that I felt I had to solve. And I did 98% of the time only by researching.

### **Communication and Teaching**  
In the ten years travelling, I have greatly improved my communication skills personally and professionally. It is a neverending journey.  
I am a great listener and observer. Working in customer-focused jobs, I had to deal with so many people every day while staying calm.  
In Getir, I had to manage a team of over 20 colleagues. Employees would call every day with new issues and requests. With active listening, empathy, and organisational skills, I was able to maintain a happy team.  
I have trained many colleagues in previous roles or explained how things work to fellow students (even during the Makers pre-course). I often received positive feedback and helped many people get unstuck.
